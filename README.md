### Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school
board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access
to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your
task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

### Instructions

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must
include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

### Written Report (Conclusions)

The PyCitySchoolAnalysis provides an overview of school district metrics and performance, including district-level and school-level summaries, performance by grade, and performance by various school characteristics such as spending, size, and type.

1. **Performance Comparison by Spending**: One conclusion drawn from the analysis is that there is a correlation between school spending per student and academic performance. Schools with higher spending per student tend to have higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher percentages of students passing math, reading, and overall performance. Conversely, schools with lower spending per student tend to have lower academic performance metrics.

2. **Performance Comparison by School Type**: Another conclusion is that there are differences in academic performance based on school type. The analysis shows that charter schools, on average, outperform district schools in terms of average math and reading scores, as well as in the percentages of students passing math, reading, and overall. This suggests that the type of school (charter vs. district) may influence academic outcomes.
